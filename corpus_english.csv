It keeps telling me to update my Google Drive but I already have the latest version. I NEED TO DOWNLOAD FILES COME ON!
Nope. Dont like it and never will... Replying to the response... Just remove it from the app store and Ill be happy
It is very bad app google should ban this app
I tried everything! But the icon for me to use for marking work refused to appear on my tablet. It appears on my phone though after sometime miraculously on its own. Can the team get to solving this bug quickly and restore our usage the way it was before when syncing across devices and using different devices to mark work used to be as claimed by the app?
I hate homework
"Its too laggy, sometimes the work doesnt even pop up. The entire screen freezes and then it cuts my wheels laptop off."
Files are not being saved offline.
Since the beginning of this year Ive been unable to save files offline despite uninstalling multiple times
Cant save all files offline at once üò°üò°üò° really disappointing
It doesnt notify me about my class
It sucks
So bad üò´ cant even login üò≠ Worst app ever ‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞üò≠
Cant even put me in good mood
I cant download an offline file even though I updated my google drive
Google acount is not added to classroom
My school account wont work on Google classroom on my phone it works anywhere else except my phone.
Just bad I dont wanna use Google classroom its annoying!!
"After using Google classroom I have came to a decision that it is bad because when teachers attach pdfs and if you scroll down to fast it kicks you off and refreshes your tab which is annoying because you forgot which one you were on and also you have to scroll all the way down. Quote its so bad, I want to give you a zero but thats not possible so I give you one. Lastly, it allows teachers to give us assignments."
"Terrible garbage, wouldnt approach it with a ten foot stick"
Unable to download files offline
Absolute rubbish. Some classes dont let you attach photos to the assignments. Marking assignments as done when a Google Form is sent is definitely a bad idea. Everything loads so slowly! Right now I am trying to turn in my work. It says You cant attach work right now. Let your teacher know or try again later. And it sounds like its MY fault and the work cant be attached because of ME! Pathetic. I definitely wouldnt use it if my teachers didnt.
It kept saying that it needs the latest version of GOOGLE DRIVE... well guess what? I updated my Google drive your app still wants the updated version.. do I need to go to the future so that it could save my important files?? If I get a low grade its your apps fault.
I literally cant use the app and my teacher are failing me. ive been experiencing the class not found each time i tap my teachers task and my institutional email been receiving account action required even tho I dont need to put my account on work application
"Rubbish app, could not show any details of the post lecture post"
Please fix the bug about editing in stylus and resending the save file.
The save offline file doesnt work.
cannot download offline files
School thang
Terrible the teachers stopped teaching
Garbage upload speed and cant download files even though drive is up to date.
Loading
After update the app I cant access my existing classes. Please fix my problem as early as possible. Bcz I may miss my classes.
its very low quality
"Worked perfectly fine until a few months ago when the app decided to not let me open any PDFs for assignments about 90% of the time. Schoolworks already annoying enough as is, and having to close and reopen classroom 5-10 times before it finally lets me view an assignment is just infuriating."
I just dont like the app they should remove the app to make people happier.
"Cant add my uni account, needs fixed"
Industry society and its consequences
"When Professor Morbius confronts some morbid criminals and says its morbin time made me cry tears of joy. That scene alone justifies the fact that the movie grossed 700 morbillion dollars. I will never get tired of praising Morbius, it is one of the existing films. Its characters are acted, it has a story and it has actors. Undoubtedly one of the most movies that exist. Of all the movies Ive seen, Morbius is one of them. -Walter White2023"
Im sorry but it sucks
Shity

Always say I dont have access but its my account and it keeps on getting back at the account i dont even need. Such a waste of time

I tried uninstalling and re-installing both my google classroom app and the google drive but whenever I try to download files offline it still says to update my drive in the latest version. Its making me nuts! I have loads of school works to do and this is such a major inconvenience. Please fix this problem as soon as possible.
School = poop Im gonna destroy myself if school stresses me 1 more time. Im on my last straw. This app is doodoo and only reminds me of school and pain. üòî
Somehow I am not permitted to log in with my school account on this app but I am by miracle allowed to log in via the website. I just wanna do my school work at ease without going to the website every time.
Terrible. I spent over 3 hours on an assignment just to click save and have everything erased. I dont understand why this problem still exists years later.
I got nothing to say I just hate school lmao
Cant save offline
There is a problem with the app on android phones . It does not save the files after editing . This issue has been going on since at least 3- 4 months with no fix . Also a message pops up saying there is a bug . Even after un installing and installing the app its not working . Please fix this issue as it defeats the purpose of having this app as a teacher.

I couldnt make files offline anymore. I need my files and I have been updating both Google Drive and Classroom and it still doesnt work. Please do something about it. Youre making this difficult for students who barely have data or internet connection like me who just wanted to have offline files.
Its hard to work on my phone

I dont enjoy having classroom on my phone
"I encountered a new bug when opening an attached link from LinkedIn Learning, when clicked it suggest that I enable or download Google Chrome to open it. I already have Chrome on its latest version and allowed it to open links, I also have the LinkedIn Learning app itself and it still wont open the link, it has no issue opening links of online articles, Docs, Slides, Sheets, and YouTube videos."
"Wanted to save the files offline and asked to update Gdrive, went to update and tried again, but it still didnt work. Re-install it again and treied again, no use. Help, I am trying to do my work here..."

"My professor suddenly decided we were gonna use this app. And I cant even ‚Äúget started‚Äù. It tells me that it cant add my gmail to Google classroom and that I should try again or use another account. I did, same results as the last. Semesters gonna begin soon and Im stressing out. I tried logging into it using my mums phone, still got the same results. Please help me. Ive already informed my prof about this but I really need this fixed soon."
Its suck
it sucks
"Why should we have to use this when we have something called paper where we can do the assignments? Its way easier to write on paper than write on slides, docs, etc. and we can get more things turned in if we do it on paper. The To-Do list is confusing, and there should always have to be a due date on assignments so people know what they actually have missing."
"Previously, I can edit pdf and docs files: I can draw by stylus right over the file, press save, and app will save all my changes as a new file right near the students original file. So, student was able to see all my notes in edited files. Its not working anymore. Its been 3 months now: when I press save, the app just do nothing. I try to clear app cache, clear app data, reinstall app - nothing helps. Several of my colleagues faced the same problem. Please do take this issue SERIOUSLY."
Please add a notification to remind them that they dont turned in their work i have memory problems because of constant tasks from my teachers now that im late i cannot pass my work
"cant download files for offline use, even both google drive and classroom are updated"
Unable to save assignment. After checking the Assignment & grading the Assignment at the time of SAVE it does not Return the Assignment to the student. Entire work done in checking the Assignment is lost. Already given feedback 3 times from the App but no response. Very bad.
math class sucks
"The app has not refreshed stream or assignments since 2022. During that period of time assignments have been assigned and streams have been added to using a computer. This app is absolutely useless as currently programmed. Developer has contacted me with a question that proves they do not understand the problem. For the last 3 months this app has done nothing but taken up space. Based on developer feedback, this is now completely understood and expected."
"It works for my son, but it does not work for my daughter, and they have the same accounts but different names. So plz fix this issue"
"As a frequent procrastinator, being stuck in uploading is hell. Turned in late idc anymore"
Cant open it saying try again with new account what should I do

"The bug reported by others is still not fixed. When I go to write on a students work, the work is very blurry. After Ive done any annotations and press save, the app crashes and no markings are saved. I have cleared cache and storage, uninstalled the app, shut down my tablet and sent Google feedback. Nothing has worked and the sole reason my school uses Google Classroom and I bought a tablet was to mark students work. This needs immediate attention. We cant mark student work with a stylus"
Teacher made me do work instead of bingeing cars üò∞üò∞
Please. Fix your editing !!! As a stident it hard to use it. when it comes to editing sometimes your text has been disappear!!!! Im so disappointed to this app .tsk!!!
"Used to work well, and as a teacher was great to mark with as it saved a copy of the edited doc with feedback. However it now crashes instead of saving the doc and loses all the notes. This is frustrating and Google dont seem to want to acknowledge the issue .... Awful Update after Googles response..... Still the same. Have tried all suggestions and reinstalled, still awful."
The thing about this app is that am trying to go in my class with Email and it doesnt work uhh üò°üò°üò°üò°am so mad and its due January 9 when i go back to school my teacher is going To be so mad at me am rating it A one.

"I cant add account, i keep getting the message couldnt add account to classroom. Try again or use another account"
Very difficult to navigate through the user interface. Assignments are difficult to load PPT files wont open There is no option to reorganize the theme It lacks a proper timeliness format especially with Assignments and class work.
There is no improvement from last 2 months edited pdf is not saving only. If your desiging ur app as per IOS then write this clearly.
"Thank you for your reply, but the problem is still persistent on all of my devices. I tried restarting the device, clearing the cache, and even reinstalling the app, yet I still cant annotate my students work."
Very poor service cant save documents as a student facing issues with the notes even teacher are not aware about this app and this app doesnt had a proper guide nonsense app.
"Bad, school is a test. Answering it correctly according to the system isnt good."
I hate school I hope it gets banned
"terrible app for submitting the answer, the button even cant selected"
Google classroom still broken. Google drive had an update and i updated google drive yet still I cant save file offline. Edit: I reinstalled gclassroom but now I cant add an account so its practically useless now.

"For the past weeks that Im using this, i thought it was ok but then it started to not work. I cant even go to the given link of the host for our class in meet.

"Good app. But, I dont get notified of many of the assignments or announcement the teachers make, thus making me missing them. I also would love a read all button on the notification part, I always have notifications unopened tho I have already seen them and in order to get them opened I have to go one by one. Lastly, I have had some problems when uploading my assignments, sometimes it wouldnt upload and I wouldnt send it, moreover getting scolded by the teachers when it wasnt my fault."
Having a problem in saving PDFs and document files for offline mode..
"Good but hard to import a specific file, it almost got me fired too."
I cant download files offline... please fix it

"Ive been using the save offline feature for a long time cos by default it takes a ton of time to open a 2 MB pdf, but now I cant even do that! It just says update your Google Drive despite it being in the latest version!! PLS FIX THIS GOOGLE"
"Awful. Tried so many times on the get started button, putting my Google account but it always says couldnt add account, try again or log in another account. Because of this, I miss so many activities or updates from professors. Wasted my time"
I was doing my worksheet and suddenly this freaking app just shut down by it self ??!! I was at the last number and i need to restart. Please fix !
When my teacher puts an assignment on a date for it to be released. It hardly happens when its supposed to.
Worst app. The app does not open pdfs sent by other people. PDFs cant even save
"Cause We cant change are names other than are emails , and i tech grade 1-2 and they dont have emails they only have names so google class should make the option in adding people that just write name or email so we can chose also can change the app name like when u open it above it is written google classroom they should g us opition to change name to whatever we want and i have more resons but i am very dispoint of what they have in app and what they show before downloading the app improve pz"

Why it is slow to install my internet is fine.

Unfortunately Google Classroom on mobile is very buggy and doesnt have many features.
trash app
I tried to make notes offline. It says it need to update Google drive to new version. But new version or update of Google of drive is not available at the time. This is a bug I guess.
"App was working fine before, but now I dont see any updates on my childs classroom . Keep getting error that  something went wrong, check your internet connection"
This sucks its used for school :(
"Cant save offline. I also tried upgrading the Google drive but nothing works. Now I cant open it when Im in class and I cant answer the files that were being sent. Back then I can answer the files or edit it, and it made my life easier back then. But now I cant, please fix this. My hands are tired now, writing the answer of the quizzes that were being sent. Too much have been going on in my life and this only add my suffering. :-|"
"I had no problems until around Feb 2023. I have a Samsung S6 Lite Tablet. Usually, I can press the edit button, write on the PDF and then save it. Now, I can do everything the same but the PDF does not save anymore or app crashes on me. I have gone to the same HELP pages as the other reviews have been suggested. I have tried every which way possible. Uninstall, reset, reinstall, clear data, clear cache, restart everytime to ensure, etc. This is 100% an app issue. This happened last year as well."
I guess all of us here are experiencing the same problem of not being able to download file or save offline. It keeps saying update google drive (even though its updated to the latest version) but keep saying update to latest version. Google classroom fixed this issue now.
Whenever I try to log in it says I do not have access
I cant even log in into my account EVEN IF I TRIED IN DIFFERENT DEVICES AND ACCOUNT ITS STILL THE SAME WHEN I DOWNLOAD IT
Idk whats going on but i keep trying to download the app for 2days and its not downloading!

Theres this another issue I have and that is connecting to google meet. I could not automatically attend the meeting when I clicked the Icon but instead when I came to google meet it said I could not connect to the meeting. Is there any ways for this?"
"Cant view assignments at all, Keeps saying to check internet connection and that it cant refresh classes. I have gone in wifi, data, And even through a VPN just to see if it would work as well as signing in and out. Google Classroom is a poorly optimized app for Education."
Am unable to sign in pliz can you help me
Its school so I dont like it.
"The save files offline dont work, Ive been trying to save my school works offline but it keep saying that I need to update the Google drive even though its already updated."

Super horrible. I used to be able to mark the submitted assignments and return the marked scripts just by tapping save. Now I cannot even see the marked scripts. Nothing works. I even cleared the data
This app is broken! It wont allow me to save files for offline use. Before last update it allowed us to save individual file in uploaded material but in current update it forces us to download all files in the posted material and the thing which makes me furious is that the download button prompts to update the Google Drive all to latest version but theres no update. Its been more than a month that I cant access my notes through my phone. Its same case for all my class fellows using Android
I cant save file offline. It alway i need to update my google drive. I already did. I uninstall both but nothing change. Can you please fix it. The problem has been a month now. How slow google team can be?

"Bad, i cant open my lesson in computer tried google drive it not working i want to save file offline but not working fix now"
Still crashing and idk why in the app info the app only have 14 mb storage used while others have 44 mb
Couldnt use slides properly.
"Im a student, therefore I am naturally inclined to despise this application."
Hate it
Another set-and-forget offering from Google. Amazed they havent killed it off yet - probably will in 2023.
this app is so stupid just like school
Bad app
Very bad app it bad for school ptm messages etc ü§ßüòê
"The app doesnt load. Ive tried reinstalling, updating, and restarting it but it still doesnt work."
"Every time I try to add work onto an assignment and I do the work when I try to save it, it erases everything and wont let me submit it! And then when I try to insert a doc it brings it up as a PDF and its not even a doc. And its the same problem with everyone else Im on a tablet. Why is this only compatible for computer??"

"The save file offline doesnt work whenever I tap the save offline it always say I need to update the latest version of Google drive which I already have, I checked many times and uninstall and reinstall it again but still no luck.

"Google Classroom used to be great. But now, I cant save any of my markups and/or annotations. I lost so much work! Thank you for your response. But its the same...

I cant seem to reach anyone for help anywhere else."

"My predominant teaching tool is the iPad. Google Classroom teaching marking tool does not work on iPad; whenever I open my students work with their annotations, I cannot see their annotations and I cant mark their work. Whats worse now is I used Samsung Note 9 to circumvent this issue and now on my Samsung Note 9, the annotations do not save!! I have marked my students work 9 times and all of it doesnt work. This is incredibly frustrating... Google please help I am at my wits end."

I updated it, also turned off the transfer files only over Wi-Fi but it is still so slow even if most of the files are only 3-7 MB. My connection isnt always stable so I opt to save files when the signal is strong, but yeah it still takes so long."
"I cant save the files offline, it always says requires the latest version of Google drive but my drive is already updated. I tried clearing the cache but no luck still the same. and I restarted my phone still not working. Please do something about this ASAP. The link youre giving it just leads me to Google. Better Fix this bug. And dont give us a useless answer. Before I rated youre app I read the comments first and I did what you told them to do but none of them worked."

When I click the pencil icon, it does allow me to write on the doc/pdf, but it doesnt save the file when I click the floppy disc / save icon. This is extremely frustrating. I have sent feedback to Google Classroom several times, but I havent received any help as of yet. *Update: tried the suggestions, but sadly it didnt work."

My school admins blocked all android devices from using google classroom.
Its error and cannot connect the internet
Cant save files offline
whenever you try to scan in a PDF/JPEG from the camera it autocrops it TERRIBLY. every single time you have to go in and manually correct the crop (which you often cant do because it autocrops like off the screen) theres NO WAY TO TURN THE AUTOCROP OFF. whose idea was this?!?!

"This didnt help me..Ive tried to do the same work from another Android Device and saw the same result. But from Windows this is not happening and from web version of this app.Please do something..I cant open any task, I open and it closes.Please help me by solving this Problem."
This is in response to the Googles response. This is now happen on two different devices and after searching the web there are many other users experiencing the same problem. Telling people to simple update the already latest version of the app or clear their cache when that clearly is not the problem is not helpful. Fixing the problem on your end is helpful.
Couldnt add account to Classroom. Try again or use another account.
"The app it self is good, but the UI. Doesnt match the current UI style of android 13 and doesnt have dark mode. They should focus on adding more feature"
Not working for some part of my link

This enables schools to leech my time away from the accursed building further than they already do.

"So slow in downloading files offline back then. Now it doesnt download files offline because it wants me to update my google drive. Ive been updating my google drive, uninstalling and reinstalling it, still not able to download offline. What a bad app. I wouldnt use this if only my instructors use another app or medium for giving assignments. This app is so frustrating."
"Not working in Galaxy Tab S8+ but works flawlessly on iPad. When I use the pen and save annotations the app crash, and with the iPad is great. Please fix the problem"

Its an android tablet. Hopefully, this will get resolved soon. This is the second time this has happened. its very frustrating. Edit to add: I am still having issues. It still says app has a bug."
Absolutely terrible. Cant even join a classroom.
I am not able to save my files offline
"This should be fixed asap!! The downloading files offline features is impossible to access because it keeps saying that you need the latest version updated of Google drive to save the files(Even though its already updated). I have noticed quite a few comments regarding this issue and all the replies say to do is clear cache or reinstall app, BUT THATS NOT WORKING! Seems to be the case for everyone so its definitely a general problem. Please take a thorough look and fix this issue asap !!"

The app crashes at a random without any issue
The audio keeps getting ups and down. Loud one moment and low the next. The instructor has a loud feedback but the students has low audio feedback. I cant hear my classmates speak while my instructor can hear them perfectly. The audio is breaking up. The To do List in the desktop version is not loading. Full screen mode should be automatically landscape where you dont have to turn on the auto rotate in the phone itself.
Wont download for some reason
No value if I cant even get into the app.

"It cant refresh my classes for some reason, Ive tried to restart my phone and stuff, my assignment is due at 7:30, Help"

Terrible School sucks and I hate it
I hate school
I would put zero stars but thats no an option. This app forces me to do my homework and Im not happy about it.
Its a good app but the fact that if you get a 15/20 your grade goes down so much and when u get a 20/20 your grade goes up like 2 percent
Why I cant open my account??
Slower than a dead snail.
"Every students wish to pass Thier activities but because of due dates they cant, I would give higher rating if due dates for next update will be removedüòä. Also, failing scores and points should be given."

Terrible app I hat it
Great app when its works but very buggy for me most of the time and id much rather hand the homework into my teacher than submit it on here
its school related >:(
Meh... another reason I dislike Google. I only had to install and use this app because my middle schoolers private school uses it for classroom assignments. Everything about Google apps give me the dry heaves. Just getting the apps set up alone are enough to send me screaming...or drinking. My dislike for how cumbersome Google is persists. Even took back a Google Android OS TV that just drove me mad. Going to be a painful few years for me using Google Classrom.
Wont show me my most recent class work Glicthes a lot
I hate school so I hate this apl
Wont even let me in! The most useless frustrating app I have no idea why my sons school are using it I refuse to even download it. Theyll have to connect with me another way. If I could minus stars I would.
Not a very good app

Loads slowly is hard to navigate efficiently

"This app was decent until it suddenly stopped working, tried everything but it wont update"
I hate school and get rid of this app
"It has plenty of problems but the most irritating problem is that it shows the file is a drive file, I click on the file and then it Start opening but it never open."
Its so bad that it takes time to load my subjects and sometimes it wont show anything
Most buggy school app ever. Cant submit my homework now cause this stupid app wont open up and says stuff like failed to refresh classroom. #3 top free in education.... yeah right.
"Cant even open the app now. When I press submit, it didnt get submit through. So I get missing work."
Not working for me wont let me open assignments
Nope to glichy and someone hacked my google acc and stole my info so üëé

It cant refresh classes plus I miss my task because of something wrong in Google classroom
"Why does this keep saying that it would not refresh my class ? Everythime I use this app, it keeps saying that it would not refresh the class. This is disappointing. My data and wifi is completely fine. Still, not yet I could refresh my class. If this bug or whatever this was, wasnt fixed, it would be just as futile as it was. Edit: I did everything I could to make this fixed, but nothing happened. And I cant clear app caches since I need them all for schooling."
This app is horrible its so laggy and it does not submit my assignment I got an F- because of this app my teachers think I was too lazy to do my work and now Im failing my classes also most of the work does not load and when I re-open it it kicks me out do better google Classroom!!!!!! üò°üò°üò°ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨üò°üò°üò°üò°ü§¨ü§¨

"Getting the first notification since May on August 10th hurts, man."
"DEAR PARENTS AND TEACHERS After using this app for 5 minutes Ive developed Naegleria fowleri Ive been unable to eat, walk, speak and even goto the bathroom BY MYSELF. I highly dont recommend downloading this app as you can catch the clap as well ya. Please do something about fixing these bug issues in the app thank you have a great day."

Absolutely terrible. The app is repulsing
Bullied by teacher and wouldnt let me leave after I moved classes
"After I logged out my school account, it doesnt let me sign in anymore! It keeps on saying Cant sign in. Please try another account. Wth"
Why I couldnt add my account in gclass it only say that you cant add this account.
I have used Google Classroom before suddenly it stopped working and it says that the service is not available in my country. Not only Google Classroom is difficult but also it stops working unjustly
"Worst app ever made. If I click on save files offline, it is always stuck. I cannot open specific files. Googles 1 billion dollar coders even use their brain."
"I have been using this app since 1st year college and it seems fine but now I cant upload my outputs and files, it only says the file cannot be reviewed. I hope you can help me with this matter as soon as possible."

It refuses to sign me in. Ive tried everything I uninstalled it and reinstalled and still nothing.
Horrible
"This app is always to so buggy, I can never sign into my account and it randomly signs me out for a very long time and doesnt let me log back in. Sometimes the app just says that I cant use my school account for the app"
"Because when I try to put my acc in it , it wont start it always say couldnt add account to classroom , try again or use another acc and when I try to put my brothers acc in it its still not working PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM I need this for my HOMEWORK PLEASE!!"
Couldnt download offline files Horrible experience...
Unable to open any file and images received in class room
Its terrible I cant log into any of my accounts for some reason
Very bad
"I cant log in on any google account that I have. Not my personal account, or my school account.

I just hate school a lot
The app doesnt show my work in the to do place so I have to go to each class. Which would be okay if I only had a few classes but I have about 9 including my extra credits. This app crashes quite a bit and Ive tried on different devices and its just the app. Its a good concept just not well executed. Adding later. Its still the same but now I keep getting un enrolled in my classes. I hate that I have to have this app to do my important work. It barely works
Google...im disappointed üòû why did you guys invent such a thing? üòï
Daming assigned
Cant upload my written works like tf
Google Classroom is not redirecting me to Google Meet making me late in class.

Would not recommend as there are better formats that can be used. Canvas and Blackboard are much better platforms to use than this one. They are much better for both teacher and student than Google Classroom. Save yourselve the pain and use Canvas!

Google Classroom is the worst. Plus when I tried to invite the teachers to join it didnt let me and It kicked me out then when I opened it again it crashed on me. DONT DOWNLOAD IT!!! üò™
screwww you
I cant add my Google account
Unable to unsubmit works
Scammed me ever since 2020
I hate school
This app is simple and organized. but I do say that it can be hard to keep up with assignments to do there.
Everybody give this one Star so it will get kicked off the app store
This app and service have no way for a parent to interact. The emails that parents receive are nearly useless and there is no way to properly sort in the students login. Basically you have to scroll through every assignment to get an idea of what is happening. Its a total time suck. It gets one star because there is at least some visibility into my childs work and curriculum. Otherwise it would be zero stars. Do better Google.
uhhh why cant i log in an account?üíÄ
Dont ask
It sucks
"for highschool, no classroom = No work. Simple?"

Make different section of assignment,material in stream. 5.Make announcement pin option. 6.Add dark mode. 7.Make Copy option 8.Make a group chat section. 8.Add bookmarks. 9. Add copy link to directly open section in app. 10. Add option to download files in device, which u made very badly and complicatedü§¨"
School

"I cant login through my google account why is that? Theres nothing wrong in my account, why I cant login?"
"DONT LIKE SCHOOL,AND HOMEWORK"

It good and all but there should be an option to erase documents and not keep it in my storage
I cant even open files any more cause it always says error check you internet connection while runnning on 100mbps
Recently i cant get in my class when the teacher sends the link.it cost me my exam
It sucks
If this have search option than its a very good app. But since this has no search option so i face many problems in finding my documents.
terrible experience with this appüò¨

"I cant open a file because it says wrong email, but i was using the correct email"
Everyday I see new task. Ughh!!
School work ü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æ
This app is the worst. Wouldnt recommend it to ppl from 1 month-110 years old
It barley works and when it does it doesnt show me all of my classes and/or work
"I hate it, cant change my mind"
Horrible
I dont like class so I threw my laptop and my grandma ate it

"Girl YES!!!! Millie Bobby Brown has your exact location! üòç To avoid her, you must prove that youre not in your flop era üíÄ. Then, Ill meet you at the haunted house üòòüòòüòòüíã #wap"
I have heard a lot of good about this app but it is not downloading.
"Worst app in the world, I killed my grandmother"
I hate school
It makes me learn stuff. Absolutely disgusting.
Horrible
It is horrible
I want sick days back
"really bad quality, this made it hard for me to learn and I dont reccomend using this for learning."
it was so terrible i threw my grandma out the window
It stole my credit card info when I tried to buy something on a different app. I use Nord VPN to see where all these purchases came from and boom. There I saw google classroom.
"My school uses this app. When using it I got so angry at it, that I threw my phone out the window. This lead to my phone being broken, and I couldnt get it repaired as a squirrel had stolen it. Awful app."
lag too much and worse than website
I dont wanna do school work soo just trying to get the app down üòú
"Im so stressed because of this app, I missed some of my activities because the file that I want to see is not working, i also experience lag even if my connection is okay, Ive been using this for almost 2 years!"
Whenever I try to turn in a assignment and it either takes forever or never sends.
"so hassle to save the file offline then download it from google drive, sometimes it doesnt appear on my offline files on drive, waste of time, why did you remove the download option directly from classroom?"
Remember 2020 when everybody rated this 1 to get it taken off the app store. Lets do it again.
I hate school.
Horrible app... :( Edit: I just hate the app lmao
Horrible
Cant view files
"Bring back the downloading files option back. Save files offline isnt a useful feature, it takes very long time to download."
I got this app for school (obviously) but after a few months its stopped working so I have to use the really gross ipads in school to do the work now. It doesnt get updates when theres new work so I have to do the homework in school.
This app doesnt make any sense. I am unable to add my any of one accounts.i reinstalled it but doing this doesnt solve my problem.
Worst app
I threw my phone cuz of this app because my work wouldnt save and its just so bad
It is not available to Huawei gadget...
"I liked the app at first, But honestly reviewing everything on my iPad from the past 4-3 years its really..rough. I had so many issues with starting the app, Getting work done, Its really awful on mobile devices, And I hated switching back and forth from computer/laptop to iPad/phone. It consistently stopped midway through my work and Id have to restart EVERYTHING all over again. The app can be fairly slow too, And honestly its really annoying to restart everything. Wouldnt recommend at all"
"Cant opnenmmy accout, keeps erroring, needs a permission and i dont even know which permission it talks about. This app has been on my device for a year but hasnt used it once because of the error and therefore this has contributed only stess to me. I cant rely on this app. Total 100% waste."
Google classroom is a good app but sometimes it does something to my chromebook and I dont know what it is?
Not good very leggy just not good DONT USE I WAS SCAMMED IN THIS APP

I got stage 4 cancer in my balls from using this app :/ I would rate it 0 stars if I could

This is the worst app. I got a message calling me a f*gg*t and telling me they will hit me with a train.
Wow worst app ever
Sometimes I cant even get in and my computer crashes. I tried different platforms and yet it still crashes on me.
The app is only easy when you know how to use it and its rlly hard to use so its rlly hard how to know how to use
Horrible
"Once I downloaded this app a cockroach came in through my window and stole my phone. After that, my cat went to go shoplifting. I do NOT recommend downloading this app."

It should give a pop up notification for when a assignment is close to being due, that would help a-lot so I can do my missing work before my teacher closes the said work. Im not in school atm but its just a thought that seriously only came to my mind till now. Also the layout sucks, kicks me out of it for no reason. I tried so many time to help it but nothing works. Please fix it"
"This is litterally the worst app I have ever seen, If I could rate it 0 stars.... I WOULD, this app made my last phone, FLY OUT THE WINDOW, I had to buy a whole new one, we use this in school aswell and it gave the lockers a virus where everyones stinky sweaty socks accumulated into real carpet grippers and started taking the students by force, I was luckily able to leave in time... but unfortunately I was too late, if u look at the sky it is filled with those dogs... awful"

"Still cant view attachments. The app installed is surely up to date, have tried uninstalling and reinstalling it, restarting my phone, clearing cache as suggested and Im pretty sure that there is no problem about the files permission since it can be open using browser but not with the app."
Homework is a punishment and should never existed...
BEEN USING THIS FOR A LONG TIME BUT RECENTLY I CANT VIEW MY FILES. UNABLE TO PREVIEW FILE IT SAY. WHY? HOW? BECAUSE OF LATEST UPDATE MAYBE?
Videos upload too slow when using data. No visual confirmation on where the upload is in currently in progress.
"I have used this app for 9 months and have no problems with it, but the other day I cant seem to open files and it always said Unable to preview file I am always frustrated because I cant open the files attached to that one folder. The file could always be previewed through Google drive but now I cant, I really dont know what happened but this has happened just now."
"I cant understand why, but on my Oneplus Nord CE, I have lost the ability to open files uploaded on Classroom with the last update. No matter what I try to use to open the link, even with external apps it just wont open anything, and if I try to download the files it returns me an error message saying that nothing could be downloaded. Youve literally got billions of dollars of budget, PLEASE fix your apps before releasing an update instead of churning outuseless UI changes."
Many bugs which is annoying
After the new update. I am not able to open pdfs in Google classroom.
If there were 0 star option I will give it that because when we try open it is saying to login but when we login it said please try again later or add new account I have added also but it is showing like this only.. Plz fix this problem plz it is very important for me to doing the classes
Unable to preview file showing when I open files in classroom. And the files turned into black. These things are happen to my works also. Offline files only able to view in drive
Messed up my whole reputaci√≥n
"I keep getting unable to open preview when clicking images posted by teachers. I can see the image thumb but cant open it in a larger view. However, I found if you click the edit icon, only THEN the image is viewable at larger size. Ive tried force closing and restarting the app, but the problem persists... My internet connection is fine, as I can see the previews, just not click to open for larger view. The error resides on your in-app page that opens image attachments for more details."
"After last update I can no longer open and pen annotate student work. Makes app useless. I have reinstalled and cleared data and cashe...no help...update, fixed by deleting my Google account from the tablet and then reconnecting, worked but didnt save and now same problem."
I cant attach my files
This app is very useful but I cant open the files uploaded by my professors to answer. Thats why my written task are incomplete. I already uninstalled it and reinstall but still the same. I cant still review the files. Please kindly fix the app.
Horrible
cringe
Unable to open files
"Files are unable to be opened and marked. Only workaround is to uninstall and reinstall. Clearing cache, data, force stopping, restarting does not work. Please assist me, I cant be reinstalling after marking a few papers."
Google classroom isnt properly working for me everytime Im going to open the files uploaded in classroom it said unable to preview file plss fix this!!!
"What happened to my gclass?! Everytime I upload picture or file in my class, it always say unable to preview file and when try to use the open with button, it says that my files are corrupted. Im having a hard time now to open the pictures/files that I sent. Please Im begging you to fix this."

"Since last update, application is not performing well sometimes it shows issues while marking the students assignments and sometimes it doesnt even show the previews, doesnt open the pdf that has to be checked. I reinstalled application many times but issues are still there."
Recent update made accessibility worst
"I dont know what happened to my google classroom, its keep unable to preview the file, i have checked my gogole drive and my Internet , its fine. But i must keep uninstall and install to view the file. Please fix this problem"
terrible nevewr works on my chromebook!!
it sucks
"The app does not let me connect to my work profile. Right when I set it up in my phone, a pop-up comes up and says We are sorry, but you do not have access to Classroom. Please contact your domain administrator for access. This does not make sense, as regular PC Classroom works perfectly for me, with that SAME ACCOUNT. This is very irritating. Id appreciate it if you took a look into it."
This app is just discussing I got sexually harassed and I want my money back
it would be a -10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\10
Class room Icant share anything.
"it just sucks, its always bugging and I just hate it becus school"
We dont need no education
It was working fine. But suddenly it has stopped working in mobile. None of the files sent by my students is opening. I cant even use the doodle option. Nothing is working. I have reinstalled it twice but not working again. Please fix it.
"My google classroom suddenly stopped working , it wasnt showing any assignments so I reinstalled it all over again....now it isnt let me get in my account, I am unable to login ..whats wrong with the app :|"
Worst school app
"To-do list takes too long to load. Prioritize that, please. Its very stressful to see that youve missed a deadline when its just your system lol. And nope, my internet connection is not poor. Going to Chrome and opening it there will work but what is the point of this app if you will have me go to Chrome just to load my tasks properly. I am aware there are alternatives but this is something you have to fix."
What the hell i just clicked unenrol by mistake.... There is no CONFIRMATION before unenrol ???üòï
It never let me login to my account it is the worst üëé
Sucks. Wont show my classes. DONT INSTALL BAD BAD BAD
I hate how it does not notify students when professors make changes on class posts. Im that person who always downloads PPTs right when they were uploaded. MS Teams is so much better.
Take it down
Cringe
This app gives me headache.
so many bugs example you cant remove the attachment that you attach and sometimes you cant attch too this app sucks
This app is bad
Take it off the app store
I hate school
"Previously had to uninstall & reinstall weekly due to Classroom no longer opening documents, no problems after reinstall... until next time it does this. 05/20/22: Now clicking the save button brings up the message Cant save draft. Try again or discard. So I cant create & save my posts & I cant actually save drafts either, so now I can literally do NOTHING in this app! Bad app on Samsung devices! 05/24/22: Still unable to use Google Classroom!!!"
Horrible
please fix the bug because i couldnt attach my files even though my internet is stable. i already tried several times but it seems to be not working.
App is not functional most of the time.

I hate school School is dum
Im going blind add a fkn nightmod pls.
not optimized slow refresh
I dont like it period its a waste of an app it can be better
Difficult to use.
I cant log in.
"Hasnt refreshed since September, and never works when I do try to refresh it. Frustrating and effectively useless"
It is the best
I cant submit my assignment
If youre a student like me you shouldnt use this app. Its unreliable and has no standards for getting your work done
Itna class class üò´
I used to see my classes and now its saying something went wrong try again. I uninstalled and reinstalled and nothing happened
Cant do anything without it kicking me out
"its absolutely broken, i try to look at my homework in the google classroom app and it keeo saying no class found and something went wrong with your internet, even there is no problem at all!"

üö´ not cool
"Downloading Files was too slow, Your advice isnt effective either Ive been waiting for 3 hours and yet you cant download a file that only contains 5.0MB"
Worst app in both performance as well as its purpose. I give a star only for telling my sorrow of using it and nothing else is deserved for this app.
I cant annotate my Students PDF.
This dose not work for me I dont get to do work
As a student using this i could say its not good we use it for learning new language ..i couldnt copy the text in it to translate it ..i couldnt make a voice note and we couldnt chat with other students private
"Most of the times, I cant check my students work. Even I use pen tool, check mark is nowhere to be found. Please fix iiittt"
"So Ive been trying to sign in all day and it wont let me. Ive updated the app, Ive updated the phone, Ive restarted the phone a million times. And it keep saying something went wrong. And wont let me in."
"Very slow loading, better view the classroom on chrome than this app. Doesnt update my to-do list, and missing. Needs a fix."
"Ive been trying to login to my account but it keeps showing me an error that says it failed to log in and that I should try again. Reinstalled it a lot of times but kept seeing the same error. Im positive my account email is correct as well as my password. When I tried to add an account, it keeps saying the account is already registered in the device. What gives?"
It sucks.
Useless. I cant get in because it is saying COULD NOT ADD ACCOUNT TO Classroom.
Hate it im a parnet who thinks this should be tooken down unbelievable
I cant download
"my problem of this app is there is no limitation of classwork and activities teachers keep aploading activities, can you limit the activities that teachers can apload"
"I feel really stressful about this app. Sometimes it takes time to attached my work through a file and that causes me to be late at passing outputs or whatsoever. And whenever I log in, it wont open and the notice will say try again or what."
Worst
This app makes me stressful
Who likes school in the first on place

"Bad, uploading is slow (I used 25 mins to upload a 1page document), (with internet speed 544 Mbps) and sometimes with bugs."
Whoever proposed this idea and approve it to be developed I hoped you stub your toe in the chair or desk every single day forever
Please fix the bugs and errors. The activities are not decreasing.
"when I submit the activity and then when he records it, he goes missing activities. TANGINA MO GOOGLE LLC AYUSIN MO YAN TANGINAMO."

No I a student not a teacher
It worked for a little bit but would constantly tell me to connect my internet and that something went wrong even when my internet was fully connected and nothing seemed wrong so I uninstalled it and then reinstalled it then it told me that I needed a administrator to get in
Would not let me into my school account
its bad
This app made me fail 1st grade
"Sucks sooo bad, everything crashes constantly."
I cant open files anymore so the app is basically useless to me. The buttons in the app dont work.

And this thing has a problem for not opening files like this file is not able to open.
Made my life suck
Its so useless its literally like being a bird and not being able to see glass!! I hate it.
It says I dont have access to my school email but I do
"Since its last update on April 8th 2022 Google Classroom has been giving multiple problems. Its stops editing the file in the middle, doesnt save the edited work or the screen freezes making it seriously difficult to mark assignments as all work goes to waste. Every single time have to uninstall it and then reinstall it just to get it to work again. This has been happening since the last update."
"My internet is really good but it wont let me open the slides my teacher posts,it always says connect to internet when my internet is already strong."

"Terrible organisation of the assignments given to students. And its a pain to use the inbuilt scanner which crops documents in weird angles, discarding its contents."
"Great app, if it ever works again. Its always saying something went wrong, check your internet connection and try again and just not loading anything even on a perfect wifi connection. Its broken. Edit: It works fine on browser, this is just concerning the app"
I hate my teacher
This app is Garbage

Terrible app."
This app sucks it keeps kicking me out of it it crashes it and im pretty sure that it gave my computer a virus because thats the only thing i use on it !! Worst App Ever
"The app barely functions and on the odd days it does it constantly crashes and freezes. I have missed due dates on assignments because they said they were turned in but two days later I get an email from my teacher asking where the assignment is. You are literally one of the biggest companies on the planet, cant you direct some of your more competent programmers towards this than another project."
Worst

"There was this time when I passed LATE ALMOST every tasks assigned because of the fact that the app itself didnt notify me on the first place. It neither tells me when did the teacher upload the assignments nor when was the deadline. Plus, the last time I checked the notifcations, it suddenly spammed past notifs that I have already seen few days ago. Additionally, reattaching files each second especially images is such an extremely huge struggle for us. Minimize the lags too, thank you."

Froud application
"Notice havent show,many time it happened that notification are not come with email"

I cant since in on my phone and its hard to submit work on time and it is not a good way to ask Qs to teachers
Not using properly its saying that the account is lacking everytime I have uninstalled and checked but its the same issue again and again
Too much assignment.
One of the worst apps in the history of apps
Its good. The only problem is that once a lecturer post a note. Clicking it to view full content will give you an empty field. I can see attachments but not their instructions. One has to go to the mail account which is inconvenient. I speak of reading notes posted alongside the files.
Add more features.
This is constantly lagging this site does not work rule34.xxx is much better it never lags and the assignments are graded fast do not download instead use rule34 its much easier to use and very simple with no download required!!!

Sometimes, it lags and sending documents become slow. What. What. Whatwhatwhatwhatwhat. Whats worse is Google doesnt fix the bugs, at all. Its been months, years, nothing changed. I am going insane.

I just give this app one star because why did you made this app anyway? This app made our life even harder *cries* They put deadlines and as if the internet connection in the Philippines is very fast and my teacher didnt even consider that we have a lot of modules and they just keep on putting deadlines! I hope you will limit the activities so we can live a happy life! I wish my country cannot use this app *cries again*
"I cant seem to attach my files but when I do, it just loads and wont show the whole document. Until now, I still cant pass my assignments. Pls fix this."

Personally I think this app is a waste of time as it contains satanic content which is not appropriate for my Christian granddaughter. RE is only for god. I do not accept her learning about the homosexuals as it goes against my beliefs. Science should not be taught to my granddaughter either as she will not be learning to be a doctor. She will be a housewife like me who will learn how to treat a man how he should be treated. I will be deleting this app and I would like to speak to the manager.
It always lags. Ive already update it but still not working. Please fix this immediately. Thank you
Trash
"I cant save,its not opening, i cant check files. Kindly help immediately. I have uninstalled and reinstalled. Nothing is working"

"Whats wrong with this app? Lagging, Took to long to open class, cant edit. I dont know. The worst app made by google"

very bad app dont download this app #waste ......
For some reason the app doesnt seem to work. For example when i try going into Google classroom it doesnt seem to refresh all my classes to see my work i tried refreshing it and deleting it but still it doesnt work. It shows my assignments from a month ago but for some reason it doesnt want to refresh. I tried everything i can to fix it still doesnt work.
You cant open the files attached. whats wrong with this app?
I was going to download this so I could read something easier for one of classes but I cant even log in with my school acc. I see that other people are talking about a problem with androids and stuff and I just recently saw that I couldnt access anything anymore. Please fix this cause I dont want to have to always use my laptop just to do work. To add onto that it also doesnt allow me to log into my school acc even when I look up gc on google.
"its funny how cringe you are, asking is there something we could do to help your frown upside down. are you even thinking straight? dumbass!"
"This app is dogshit, A entire year later and I still think this is a dogshit app"
as students we have difficulty because of the amount of assignment given by the teacher so just limit the assignments of the teacher
"Address: Street, Apt, City, Country/Region, Province, aqq code"
Every single time I try to go into the app it kicks me out and I cand do any of my assignments. Hopefully this gets fixed.
why not
"Bad, doesnt load right and is a pain to use in some cases."
"For the past 2 weeks the app opens, lets me open the classroom, but then crashes when I try to open the daily announcements. This is the only communication my childs school has, so its been frustrating. As I scrolled through the reviews it looks like Im not the only one experiencing this with an Android phone. The troubleshooting that was linked from Google in someone elses previous review was no help. Google really needs to fix this for Android users!"
Why Google why
Non sense I cant even open any documents in my Google classroom. I already update it every update. Install and uninstall 20 times but still cannot open any documents though available offline. What a waste of time poor app
"i wad unable to view any of my classes so I tried to uninstall it to see if that would work and now anytime I try to sign into my Google classroom it says,  you do not have access to Google classroom please contact domain administrator.

To fix this, I made the mistake of deleting the app in an effort to reinstall and have it work correctly but now I cant sign into my school account at all. While scrolling through reviews, I have noticed that this syncing error is common with samsungs and androids, and my phone us one of them. Luckily, I have an ipad that works with GC.

So many schools works given by our teacher.üòë
I dont like this app
Theres a lot of activity.
"Screen recording aint working in this app. I mean yes you can record the screen but no audio. Its hard for us student to go back to our lesson especially if the internet is weak and the subject is calculus ang p6. And also, you should limit the number of assignments a student acc can recieve, coz a lot of prof today have been taking advantage of our situation (Students at home due to pandemic) by giving alot of activities simultaneously without knowing if we are still ok."
I couldnt refresh
No learning happened
"I have an Android devise and since last week Im unable to open the assignments it show a message  couldnt refresh clases  and  cant conect, Info might be outdated  Im only able to access thru a laptop and a ios device."
I hope this app will limit the activities given by the professors. Huhu
I cant open account in other devices it says Couldnt switch account. Try again later. And in my orginal device I cant view the files that our teachers send
The worst app I have ever seen What should I say nowüí•üí•

This is one of the worst teaching apps ever made
The app doesnt update the status of the pending assignments. Heart attacks all round.... ü§¶üèªü§¶üèªü§¶üèª
This is requiem..
"Someone had the same the same name as me üôÑüôÑ My teacher also would assign homework??? Like, i dont wanna do that. What? This app is promoting learning?? That is so irrisponsible and disgusting. I would rate 0/5 but wont let me me üò°üò°üò°üò°"

as a student its easy to use but it enables teachers to be lazy and not actually teach
I hate it
My teachers send me homework

"Every few months, I try and open classroom. I end up being told that it couldnt refresh. I try over and over, but the same thing ever time. I end up un-installing it, and re-installing it. Then I cant sign into my account for the next 4 1/2 months, at the least. This has happened like 5 times. Im tired of it."
What the app the rolles are bad and the app the best app
"I dont get notified when teachers post even though i enabled notifications and i sometimes submit my work late because of that and i have tried to reinstall it, it didnt change anything :/ and also sometimes i cant submit my work, it can be very frustrating at times when the deadline is near."
Worst
"Bad app , assignment upload section must be in the middle of the screen so that student can see uploading, not in the end of the screen."
THIS IS THE WORST LEARNING APP EVER!
So slow
Thanks to google classroom my teachers are constantly bothering me. I already hated school and google classroom has made me hate it more
Why does the recording feature was removed? I dont see any reasons why It should have been removed! Its bad for people who arent able to attend a class.
I hate because my phone is not well work

Such a haunting experience using this app. How the hell can any app allow teachers to post about an exam one day before the exam? Please introduce some features where teachers are allowed to post about an exam atleast one week earlier.

Worst App poda
"Whenever I try to open a file, or upload a file, it takes ridiculously long to finally get uploaded. It is infuriating because sometimes you need to turn in within a time schedule, as for an exam. So I usually try to finish my exam 10 or 15 minutes before the allotted time, because of this stupid app. I really wish you would correct this because I saw other comments quoting the same problem here. It is a wildly popular app usedby teachers as well as students, so please do something."
It removed all my classes I am unable to get access to my notes . Exam in 3 days. Now google classroom is not responding.
I just hate school

I hate the latest update of this app. I cant take a screenshot anymore of the pages in a pdf file. I cant even download the file itself to save in my storage. I hope Google would be considerate enough to bring back what features were before.

You guys cant make one thing properly. Any Google product has either too many bugs or a severe lack of functionality. Their troubleshooting guides are too simple and dont include the problem. Their forums have generic answers by so called experts that literally are common sense which no one asked for.

"It doesnt work, it says I need to reload"

Cant do most of the functions as on a computer or laptop platform including ‚ñ™Ô∏écant attach files ‚ñ™Ô∏écant find most files that people post ‚ñ™Ô∏éyou cant open many assignments ‚ñ™Ô∏éand more If you can fix it you can if not you cant P.s. I you add dark mode and make it optional it would be better on most peoples eyes
couldnt attach the file
Its a pain in the butt. As a student certain documents and articles wont open and it doesnt work on mobile
Just because
I cant log in to my account can you fix this
Add an option to turn in assignments without having to go into the actual assignment. Would save so much gd time and would make this god for saken app less annoying.
Very bad app
Its school
Classroom is not good app
"I paid and then my subscription suddenly ended, not even able to sign in and check expenditure"
The app is automatically getting closed after opening the application a message pops unfortunately the app is not working
Does not have an unenroll option to classes

This made virtual school way harder than it shouldve been.

"When my teachers upload a pdf, videos or anything, I cant open it but if I open gclassroom on chrome it works perfectly fine."
"Fix your app. Every time I refresh my to do or missing list, everything I already done shows up as missing or undone."
So bad never works for what I want to do.
"Its rubbish, it doesnt even sign in to your account. Do not download this app."
"No one likes homework, and ur app has so many bugs"
The teachers should never use this app as it is extremely poorly set up and deserves to be taken down.
File is not uploading
Its a waste of time and it takes up to much space on my phone
I am unable to archive my previous classes.
This is a very buggy app
I hate this app my child found my sex education class on this app i need better safe storage on this app.
"Since jan 7th 2022 all google products like google meet google classroom,drive etc are showing signs of distruption .... There has been several situations in which only the session host ,my drive owner as well as classroom head can open files specified using drive as in new material, whiteboard, brainstorming charts cant be viewed by visitors or tjose who needs to acess it. the main problem for classroom is it provides pdf and other files which may be viewable to the admin/owner/head only."
When I pass my quiz or assignment it always say class not found
Amazing would give it 10 if I could.
Bad app
"Filled with bugs, laggy, private comments dont appear, hard to navigate without help. It is good for school, but almost unbearable to use."
Not able to open any class videos ..It only buffers and video doesnt open at all
Bad. Tried to log in and then i keep getting error 400. Why do we require rocket scientce to log in.
I cant remove attachments
52 missed assignments
The videos arn t open properly
No comments simply waste
Too many homework
Very bad ashil

I dont like this app
"This app is creating a huge problem, my son has 3 classrooms and today when he tried to join it was showing that something went wrong ... even he tried few more times but still showing the same thing. If this happens everyday then hell miss all the class and he re installed this app again and when he opens that app and tries to start it with his e mail Id which is given in the class, it said cannot found account or something went wrong.

"It wont let me log in and then once it does, it either kicks me out, or says theres a connection error. Ive tried everything, but nothing works."
Online classes are conducted through this only..... So idont like this

"When I go in the app it says UPDATE IT I say ok then when I go to update it, it just says uninstall or open do I cant update it."
This app made my depression worst
Bad did nothing for two months

"The worst app ever, i cant do anything."
I am having trouble logging in using a qr code. I tried on Chrome book and then on my.phone as well no matter what I try to change or how many times I turn my camera permissions on it just gives me a black screen.
Just bad. Update it more often. Its slow and unresponsive at times.

Crappie and boring doesnt work for me just üò≠ü§¨üò°üî•üòº
Worst
Wate of time
"It crashes all the time and is a hassle to use, as well as that I constantly am having trouble logging in EVEN THOUGH I know my usernamw and password."
Mam files or pdf never gets attached to any assignments it always shows couldnt attach your file
Why is my google classroom says something went wrong?
No notification showing
This is very worst app and wasting of time I have to join my class after 1 month ago but could not refresh my classes amd we have more than 3 accounts than not working i have teied two days and wait for two days but it could not refresh
Cant view videos attached even if theres an internet
Verry bad üòî I
It is good.... school not much
"When lm opening this application it is showing get started when I am clicking on it it is showing We are sorry , but you dont have access to Classroom. But I have access, in other smart phone it is alright but I dont know why it is showing this. I cant rate it 0 stars. Its the worst application"
What is wrong with this app? The mic doesnt work even after clicking.
Irritating
I dont like it it doesnt allow me to use my gmail
Very üòî
Sometimes I am getting error with this
This google classroom
Its school based what did you expect?
The app in general is un necessary. My reasoning are that it is very annoying to manage and too complicated. It also is unnecessary because you can just use email.
"Used to work well last semester, I dont know what happened. Says that it is experiencing problems and assignments dont load."
"Do you please tell me why it always shows (Woohoo, no work due soon!)even when my classes started"
"How can this app be SO badly coded? You cant fix even the basic stuff... a year ago this app was good: it was responsive, it showed me the assignments I had to complete, had notifications (before you removed it from the app just to come back with them again), etc. Nowadays its completely useless. Its not reliable, takes an incredible amount of time to refresh, removes assignments from my completed tab, etc. How is it possible that a company as big as Google develops a product like this?"
Hate this app
"Loading in so slow, not properly working, links are an error. Nothing even works properly, it is very bad app, Do Not Recommend. Notifications not working at all."
This is a cheap website. It doesnt help your children learn anything. Im a student myself and havent learn anything yet.
Searching for classroom is hyping this app. Let Mr search Google.
"I am using this app since last year. But now with new version i got fully disappointed . When I go to my previous year classrooms to send the same pdf files in this session ,the option has been disappeared and asking for link and all. Its a request Kindly, updated the old version only. Please take it this seriously. So much problem we are going through with this new version. Totally disappointed."
School is mid
I do not want to go to class and this app aways says something went wrong üòí like be real
Bad app
"Please consider putting an option in each classroom where files or modules can be organize. Like adding Folder than can be renamed. Its so tiring to scroll back and forth to look for the added classwork, modules, activities, assignments etc theyre all mixed up. Its giving us so much headache. I hope youll be able to look into this idea."
"The files wont open no matter how many times I tap to open, how am I supposed to do my assignments properly if I cant see them?"
Gandu created this app
Showing error while adding account . What should i do?
Very very discussting I hate this app
Worst app I am not able to see my recordings of classes it always shows something went wrong
It just sucks as a whole
Gives students anxiety
Bad app dont use it at all

"It is good app but I want to report a problem regarding tiles that are there during meet.

I just want to hide that tile so that shared content is fully visible. Kindly resolve my problem or provide some solution. Regards."
I am trying to save my account but it is not working

Cant download it
Wont allow me to sign into my Google classroom. I have an existing class and the app is asking to sign in as a new user and creating a new account. After choosing new user account it is giving me a new email. I have a personal Gmail and it isnt my google classroom email. I uninstalled the app 2x and have turned my Google pixel 6 pro many times. Frustrated with the quality of this app. Not user friendly!
I cant refresh and cant see the updates
I hate classrom
I submitted a classwork and when my teacher would return it it is an error my teacher tried on my other classmates and its an error too

Very bad compared to other learning based websites
"Cant refresh class, my submitted works and outputs are now missing."

Almost every time I send my work its not sending for me I am not sure why..
Worst

"When I try to post my homework, taking a photo does not work. It Just shows me a placeholder image and I cannot open the file. The bigger problem is that the teacher cannot see that picture as well"

WORST APP üò£üò£
"Some when I try to join class it shows that the meet code you are using did not match to the call,even if I use the right one."
"Ok ok, This app is just hands down horrible. I try to look at my assignments on mobile and it takes about 17 minutes. And before you go saying iTs yOuR iNtErNeT Trust me, it isnt. It also constantly makes me join back into my classes because I get kicked out for some reason. Im disappointed with this app. Maybe if they fix these problems I will fix my review but till then it stays at a 1."

after an update i cant open the videos that my lecturer upload . it takes time to load but still cant open . I already try to refresh but still cant open the video so please do something about this because the video is so important for me
For the boys
Honestly this is a good app but it lags a lot even with good internet thanks to google classroom we had to buy a new wifi conection 2 times! And it barely works on a iphone and a tablet and with the computer is even worse if thier was a 0 sfar I would do it.
Horrible
"For some reason I do not have access to my classrooms, even though Im choosing the right account. Whenever I do have access, it says Something went wrong. Please fix this app."
It bad
OMG who has google classroom its amazing and all that stuff
Please fix the issue of this app I having trouble of opening those files especially that new features of Google classroom
Horrible freaking trashed app
Schoolwork
Horrible app. Keeped bugging out.
"App used to work and now crashes when trying to few videos. Frustrating during another period of remote learning. I have already tried updates, reinstalling and clearing history etc."
My files are not opening...even though I have uninstalled and I have good internet connection
"After the recent update, downloading an attachment has become a big headache.. resolve this issue."
garbage. slower than my braincells at 2am
This wont even let sign in to my account
This is rubbish. Cant sign in says I dont have permission for access
"Whenever I want to attach files, photos, and documents it takes forever to be attached and sometimes it crashes for no reason please work on that"
I hate to the core
No school!!!!
"The old version of this app is better, because now, its very difficult to insert pictures, videos or files and endless loading, there are times when Im late in passing tasks even though I did my assignment early. Its just sad that the effort I put in just to do it early seems worthless, because the app didn‚Äôt work well even though the internet connection was strong."
Im only doing this because my friend told me to.
Worst
This is useless
"We cant attach photos directly from camera,we need to save the image in drive,very bad......"
"Im sorry, but why my file cant be opened after i update this app? can someone explain?"
Too much homework
I am rating this one because nowadays Im not getting the notes which teachers are posting on it
I cant save files offline its nonsense says always to turn off turn off transfer files over wifi only in drive but l already kept it off please fix this Bugg üò°üò°
It consumes a lot of data when we apply files for offline even a 500kb pdf also consumes over 100mbs It is too costly
It was freaking terrible
It takes too much time to load the files. FIX IT DUMMY
Notification Spam
I hate this app its not bad its just noü§¢
Very useful to teachers but not us
"Im facing problem while opening pdf files in my phone. (Error code:something went wrong, try again, Unable to open this file) Please look into this issue & let us know as soon as earlier."
"The app is good and all but it will not show me my classes for this year, and I cant get the codes from my teachers."
"With the terribly slow upload speeds, on any wifi connection, the hard to understand use, the unstable logins and much more you would think google would spend more time fixing this. In times like now this app could help save us all but instead it only makes things harder and more frustrating for students and teachers alike. I expected better from a company as big as google. Its barely deserving of the one star rating I have given it and its overall 2.6 stars."
"Terrible app. If I could leave -5 stars, I would. It wont let me upload assignments that are crucial to me passing my classes, usually the assignments that are worth the most amount of my grade. Should be taken off the app store. I failed 4 classes (in the last year) due to this app. I never want to have to use it again. It is very unfortunate because it was a very good app before this happened, but now I cant trust it to get my assignments uploaded, nor loaded or turned in. Again, terrible app."
I have to do work on this appüò§
Ew now I have to take class
So annoying that when I try to make a new account it has 1000000000 questions in it it take 30hours because of this I become blind!üë®‚Äçü¶Øüë®‚Äçü¶Øüë®‚Äçü¶Øü¶Ø

My teachers are finally learning to use Google classroom properly, but google classroom is more of a notes app. We need an app that allows us to do school work, not a notes app. Trying to figure out what is due and when is a huge struggle"

"Dark mode on Google classroom is one of the most requested feature since ages. I dont understand why this app still doesnt have dark mode built in. Students spend a lot of time staring at this app daily, so its more of a necessity than an optional feature. I hope this would get implemented soon."

NO APPLE PENCIL SUPPORT. A few of these are to do with IOS things but students are forced to used IOS a lot of times and are forced to use this bloated, clunky, inconsistent, slow, frustrating app."
Ew this app does not work 99.9% of the time for me!
Keeps crashing would give it 1 but its not an option

Worst App When You Scroll Down Sometimes Some Files cant Be found.
It takes too much time before uploading files especially videos. Sometimes the uploading files also were missing that it takes too much effort to upload it one by one.
Its so ugly and tired when ever look at the deadline its says deadline tommorow i wish all deadline is limited buta its ok if the deadline is like next year
"Yesterday I updated the app as my son school is using this app since last year,but today I was unable to laod the answer sheet of PDF as it was showing continuous in progress for almost 20 minutes,which was very smooth before the upgradation"
You need to add some limits on numbers of works so it should be not hard for us to do it.

"It keeps on saying null failed to upload although I have a strong internet connection. I have already updated my app and restarted my phone but it keeps on failing uploads on my first try. You should improve your app for the students who are struggling, and to the teachers also. I have failed more than 5 quizzes just because I have the same problem which leads to late submissions."
Unable to open some of the file
It consumes more data very poor app

Please improve notification system. It wastes a lot of my time looking through which of my courses has a new notification. Too little customization options (for organization). Absolutely frustrating to use. Notification symbols for new posts in each class would be great.

Please contact your domain administrator for access. I definitely have permission to use classroom, and I found that many people online have the same problem as I do, for months, and there has been no solution to it. This bug has caused me plenty of inconveniences, especially when I need to check it before class, or in other dire situations, since I could not access the classroom. Please fix this bug google."

Simply waste
"Since January 5th 2021 this app has been very difficult to use. It seems riddled with issues only uncovering themselves at the MOST inconvenient times. This app was good for education previously but now its causing more problems then its worth. I simply just wished teachers stopped using this as it actively makes school harder. My classes disappear, my assignments arent visible to me in my own docs that are FULLY visible in google docs and takes a unrealistically strong connection. Please fix."
"Student; I had no problems with it and it has worked fine through middle and high school. Usually I use it to view homework or the key to see if I got answers right. But, like two days ago, a bug has occured where when I tapped on my class it disappeared. And so far they havent come back. As well as it says it couldnt refresh my classes. I hope you can fix this bug soon."

Try again or use another account everytime I try. Hoping for the solution, thanks."
Very bad app. When I used to open this app it sometimes become error . It takes too much time to open . I am updating it in every week then also this problem happens.

Nothing happens on refreshing it just says Last Refreshed on 12th Sept So I tried reinstalling the app but now I can not add my kids school Google account as it shows error this account cannot be added to Classroom This is a widespread issue please fix it. Countless students are relying on this service to attend school. Please escalate it to concerned team. Link you have replied to others is simply Google search link."

"Help, bug fix this, i cant open it. It says couldnt add account to gcr, please use another account."
Its good working and also important for work but it also shows some problems like 1. At sending Assignment time a add will come up. 2. Too slow to send any assignments. If you can so I am requesting to fix it.

"I think theres something wrong with this app. I open my gclassroom today because we have a quiz to take, but suddenly all of my subjects disappeared, so I uninstalled and installed it again and then log in to my google classroom email, my email is correct so does my password, but it says that Couldnt add account to Classroom.

Hello google I dont understand why you named this app as google classroom because in this app we can only submit the works thats all in this app why cant you make this as a virtual classroom like if a class is going on this app automatically records. The audio and video because some students cant understand In one time so if the recorded video will be there it will be helpful for slow learners and u can also make a chat session which we can easily be able to get notes and all in

"Why does it sometimes gives me notification but sometimes do not? Even when it gives one, its gonna be like 2 or 3 hours after the material/assignment has been given. I once almost missed my class because the notification didnt pop up. Thought it was a good app at first until this problem started to annoy me."
why cant i download the app
Google theres a bug! When I log in in to google classroom at my phone. I saw all my assigment was missing. All of it. Those assigment were done in early days but theyre appear to be missing. I need to refresh every single assigment and than it will apear mark. I wasted alot of my precious time just to refresh every single assigment. I report many times at google feedback but no one fix. Im so dissapointed of you google classroom.

"I would best describe Google Classroom for mobile as an incredibly stupid dog. Half the time it actually does what you want it to and the other half its dying because it forgot how to breathe.

Hard to find assignments at the end of the year work gets lost and its really confusing üòï
"Downloaded for my sons school. Will not allow me to access and installs work profiles. Does the same when trying access it via chrome. However, signs in fine on an ipad, Firefox and any other Internet browser - apart from Google, bizarre."

"Wife and I have both tried installing, uninstalling, reinstalling this app on Android phones but to no avail. Just met with not authorized user. Contact administrator. Our administrator is my 3rd graders teacher who doesnt know anything about technology. Thankfully, the app works on our iPads, but we arent walking around with those daily and not all people have iPads. We need alerts in real-time. I have no clue what fix Google put in over the summer, but it had the opposite effect."

Earlier it was easy for me to edit and attach my students work day by it become worse it takes nearly 3-4 minutes to attach an edited file and returning takes a about a minute each and every one with your reply I have even undergone Speed test for my connection of internet which got a good result
After the new update I had faced a new issue that is while the teacher or someone else shares a screen then when we pin it we are getting our profile at right bottom side so that it occupies some space on the screen so that screen is not visible so plzz rectify this prblm as soon as possible and also improve the feature of giving audio permission while screen recording orelse improve itself a own feature of screen recording with audio in the app itself
I wish there was an edit option for the work we upload
"There is a problem that when someone shares screen, when we pin the screen sharing our profile is occuring at right bottom side so that half of the screen is not visible by this profile so please retufy this problem quickly"
This app is the worst :)
This is one troublesome app. I submitted a test and got 17 marks but at the day of the evaluation it said missing which greatly affected my scores. Very disappointing.
Why not
".when i submit my pdf file from cam scanner instead of turn in,here showing handed in.Though this two words have the same meaning but my teacher said he did not find my file,others my batchmate also send same file,there show turn in,and teacher also got their file.Whats wrong with me?"

This app is really worst than other apps. When i try to upload my work it takes forever to upload. We use it in our exams and it actually takes too much of time and our exam is over.

Do fix these problems otherwise your app is going to be even more worst and you all are gonna get 0 ratings.

"I thought it would be a good idea to try this out with my class and as a result, it did not go as planned. I couldnt hand back assignments to my students and for some reason it would not let me give any more assignments.

I want to suggest some points for making education better in online world: (1)-Poll option for voting.

(4)-Fast loading speed of Google Classroom (fast upload of files in Google Classroom). please implement this for mobile and pc users both for good education

"1) The homework attachments disappear in a day. Now, we cannot find out if this is software issue, or the class teachers have removed the attachments. There should be a log of activities done on each work created. If a file has been removed, it should state there in the log (probably at the bottom of the page.) If the work of child is lost, then this software is not up to the mark. 2) The work created is neither listed in the order by date, nor there is any option to sort them. It becomes very hard to find the assignment."
Still getting the experience
They can easy your online classes

i noticed a huge bug ..which i wasnt aspecting from Google..!! Bug: I was trying to submit my homework at 11:59:40pm and it was uploading.. But at 11:59:55pm it says missing.. And at sharp 11:59:57 my homework is uploaded..!! But it says handed in done late.. But i submitted in the same day which was the last submission day..but 5 seconds before..
